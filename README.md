xptMiner
========

xptMiner is a multi-algorithm miner and reference implementation of the xpt protocol. It currently supports Protoshares, Metiscoin and Scrypt (slow)
For this project I tried to focus on clean code as well merging all the various algorithms into a single project. While performance is only secondary, I'll do speed optimizations if time allows.
